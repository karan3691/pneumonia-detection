# Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-Ray Images

This project implements a deep learning model (CNN) to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. The model is deployed as a web application where users can upload X-ray images and receive predictions.

## Features

- Deep learning model (CNN) for pneumonia detection from X-ray images
- Transfer learning with pre-trained ResNet-50 architecture
- Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics
- Web application for real-time predictions
- Grad-CAM visualizations for model interpretability

## Dataset

This project uses the [Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia), which contains thousands of labeled X-ray images categorized as normal and pneumonia.

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pneumonia-detection.git
cd pneumonia-detection

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Data Preparation

```bash
python src/data/download_data.py  # Download the dataset from Kaggle
python src/data/preprocess.py      # Preprocess the images
```

### Model Training
